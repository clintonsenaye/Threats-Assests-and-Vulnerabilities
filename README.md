<h2>Threats, Assests and Vulnerabilities</h2>

In this course, I gained insights into asset protection determination, risk management, and NIST framework standards. I delved into threat, vulnerability, asset, and risk definitions, emphasizing security's role in mitigating organizational risk. We explored the uses and benefits of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, as well as data classification and privacy considerations. My expertise grew in security controls encompassing encryption, authentication, and authorization systems for safeguarding digital assets and maintaining privacy. I gained an understanding of vulnerability management, the differentiation of vulnerabilities from threats, the assessment of risks through vulnerability assessments, the adoption of a defense-in-depth strategy, and the identification of common vulnerability exposures by MITRE. Moreover, I comprehended various threats targeting digital assets, cybercriminal tools and techniques, and the threat modeling process to proactively counter security breaches. This knowledge equips me to protect assets effectively and anticipate evolving threats.

Project Activity: Analyzing a vulnerable system for a small businessAnalyze a vulnerable system for a small business

<h4>Project Description:</h4> 

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.
